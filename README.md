This database is part of my 11DTP develop a database assesment. 
for the code to work properly, you have to install python imaging library (via terminal is 'pip install pillow'), for the image, and probably the rest of the code to work. 
This database contains information on 70 different military and civilian planes, and the python file runs a tkinter window with different options for sorting.
